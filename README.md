Away3D Lite
=============

Fastest and smallest 3d engine for Flash 10+.


Stage3D (new)
-----
Now with new Flash 11 Stage3DRenderer (WIP). 

The goal is to have a rudimentary (but simple and fast) Stage3D renderer for simple 3D scenes.

**TODO:**
 - fix leaks!
 - fix projection to match exactly the FP10 output (it's close but not enough to reuse the original mouse handling),
 - implement more shaders (precomputed-alphas fixing, color material).

**Example usage:** 
 - code: https://gist.github.com/3659167
 - running: http://philippe.elsass.me/lab/away3dlite-stage3d
